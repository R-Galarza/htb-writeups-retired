# OWASP Top 10 (2025) – Hack The Box Retired Labs

This repository contains detailed writeups of **retired Hack The Box machines**, focused on understanding **real-world security vulnerabilities** rather than solving CTF-style challenges.

Each writeup documents the **complete Proof of Concept (PoC)** used to exploit the machine, explaining *why* the vulnerability exists, *how* it can be abused, and *what* should be done to remediate it.

The goal is to bridge the gap between offensive techniques and defensive security practices.

## Scope & Approach

All content in this repository follows these principles:

- Only **retired Hack The Box machines**
- Clear exploitation paths, not guesswork
- Emphasis on **web application security**
- Vulnerabilities mapped to **OWASP Top 10** where applicable
- Practical remediation strategies included

This is not a collection of shortcuts or flag-focused walkthroughs.  
It is intended as **hands-on training material** for learning how vulnerabilities manifest in real environments.

## What Each Writeup Includes

Each machine writeup typically covers:

- Target overview and attack surface
- Vulnerability identification
- Full Proof of Concept (PoC)
- Exploitation methodology
- Impact analysis
- Root cause explanation
- Remediation and defensive recommendations

Where relevant, machines are mapped to common security categories such as:

- Broken Access Control
- Authentication & Authorization flaws
- Insecure configurations
- Business logic vulnerabilities
- API security issues

---

## Learning Objective

By documenting full exploitation chains and remediation strategies, this repository aims to:

- Improve vulnerability recognition skills
- Reinforce attacker mindset thinking
- Encourage secure-by-design principles
- Provide realistic examples for blue and red teams alike

---

## Disclaimer

All writeups are based on **retired machines** and are shared strictly for **educational purposes**.  
No real-world systems are targeted or encouraged to be attacked.

Always curious. Always testing.
